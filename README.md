# Comparison Study of Soil Moisture and Matric Potential Sensors

This repository holds the data and a exemplary script accompanying the publication by Jackisch et al. 2018: Soil moisture and matric potential -- what do we measure? submitted to Vadose Zone Journal.

The Jupyter Notebook reads data from a field comparison of numerous sensors for soil moisture and matric potential. It uses an Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) for spectral recomposition of the recorded signals in order to avoid any assumptions about offset or scaling between the individual time series.

The notebook is given under GNU GPL3, the data under CreativeCommons BY-NC-SA 4.0 without any liability.
